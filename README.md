### Short Biography
I was born in Xi’an, China. I received the B.E. degree in *Observation Control Techniques and Instrumentations*, and the M.E. degree in *Measurement Technology and Instrumentation* from **Xidian University**, Xi’an, China, in 2009 and 2011, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in *Electrical Engineering* from **University of Hawaii at Manoa**, Honolulu, HI, USA, in 2016. After graduation, I was with Adnoviv LLC, a startup company co-founded by my PhD advisor Dr. Olga Boric-Lubecke as VP of Technology developing Doppler radar based occupancy sensors. 

His research interests include RF and microwave, analog circuit design, Doppler radar physiological signal processing, physiological monitoring sensors, and infrared motion tracking.
Dr. Gao is a Student Member of the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society (MTT-S), and the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS). From 2013 to 2014, he was the Vice Chair of the IEEE MTT-S Student Branch Chapter (SBC) at UH-Manoa. Since 2014, he has been a Secretary of the SBC.
